# End-to-End Google Earth Engine by Ujaval Gandhi

<div style="text-align:center"><img style="width:33%" src="static/imgs/spatial_thoughts_logo.png"></div>

This repo reproduces [Ujaval Gandhi](https://github.com/spatialthoughts)'s JS-based course ["End-to-End Google Earth Engine"](https://courses.spatialthoughts.com/end-to-end-gee.html) using Python and [`geemap`](https://github.com/giswqs/geemap). 

The course covers a wide range of topics in Google Earth Engine to give the participants practical skills to master the platform and implement their remote sensing projects.

The only requirement to follow the course is to have a Google Earth Engine account. For that, Visit the [sign-up page](https://signup.earthengine.google.com/) and sign-up with your Google account. You can use your existing gmail account to sign-up. It usually takes 1-2 days for approval. Hence do this step as soon as possible.
